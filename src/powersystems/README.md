# 🔌 Power Systems Simulation Overview

This folder contains various power system models used for the experiments in this research.

## 🧪 Workflow Overview

To run a simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Call the system** by its name.
2. **Feed in the distribution** of the injected power.
3. **Obtain the results**, including voltage magnitude and angle.

This setup enables the evaluation of system behavior under different power injection scenarios.
